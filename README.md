NDK (Nostr Development Kit) is a Dart library that enhances the Nostr development experience.\
NDK supplies you with high-level usecases like lists or metadata while still allowing you to use low-level queries enhanced with inbox/outbox (gossip) by default.\
Our Target is to make it easy to build constrained Nostr clients, particularly for mobile devices.
